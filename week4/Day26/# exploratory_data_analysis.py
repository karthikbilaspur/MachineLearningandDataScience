"""
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an important step in data science and data analytics 
as it visualizes data to understand its main features, find patterns and discover how 
different parts of the data are connected.
"""

def why_eda_is_important():
    """
    Helps to understand the dataset by showing how many features it has, what type of data 
    each feature contains and how the data is distributed.
    Helps to identify hidden patterns and relationships between different data points which 
    help us in model building.
    Allows to identify errors or unusual data points (outliers) that could affect our results.
    The insights gained from EDA help us to identify most important features for building 
    models and guide us on how to prepare them for better performance.
    By understanding the data it helps us in choosing best modeling techniques and adjusting 
    them for better results.

    """
    There are various types of EDA based on nature of records. Depending on the number of 
    columns we are analyzing we can divide EDA into three types:
    
    1. Univariate Analysis
    Univariate analysis focuses on studying one variable to understand its characteristics. 
    It helps to describe data and find patterns within a single feature. Various common 
    methods like histograms are used to show data distribution, box plots to detect outliers 
    and understand data spread and bar charts for categorical data.

    2. Bivariate Analysis
    Bivariate Analysis focuses on identifying relationship between two variables to find 
    connections, correlations and dependencies.

    3. Multivariate Analysis
    Multivariate Analysis identify relationships between two or more variables in the dataset 
    and aims to understand how variables interact with one another which is important for 
    statistical modeling techniques.
