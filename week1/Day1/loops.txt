Loops in Python are like, super handy, ya! 🤩 They let you run a block of code repeatedly, which is awesome for when you've got a task that needs doin' multiple times. Python's got two main types of loops: for loops and while loops.
For Loops
for loops are used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string). Here's a simple example:
Python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
This'll output:
Code
apple
banana
cherry

While Loops
while loops run as long as a certain condition is true. Check this out:
Python
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
This'll output:
Code
0
1
2
3
4

Loop Control Statements
You can use break to exit a loop early, and continue to skip to the next iteration.
Python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
This'll output:
Code
0
1
2
Python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
This'll output:
Code
0
1
2
4


Nested loops are like, loops within loops, bro! 😎 They're super useful when you've got to iterate over multiple sequences. Check this out:
Python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
colors = ['red', 'green', 'yellow']

for fruit in fruits:
    for color in colors:
        print(f"{fruit} is {color}")
Output:
Code
apple is red
apple is green
apple is yellow
banana is red
banana is green
banana is yellow
cherry is red
cherry is green
cherry is yellow
Here's what's happenin':
The outer loop (for fruit in fruits) grabs the first fruit, "apple".
The inner loop (for color in colors) iterates over all colors for "apple".
Once the inner loop finishes, the outer loop moves to the next fruit, "banana".
The inner loop runs again for "banana".
You can nest loops as deep as you need, but be careful not to go too crazy, or it'll get messy! 🤯


explain me various statements
In Python, you've got several statements that help control the flow of your code. Here are some key ones:
If-Else Statements: For conditional execution.
Python
x = 5
if x > 10:
    print("x is big")
else:
    print("x is small")
For Loops: For iterating over sequences.
Python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
While Loops: For repeated execution based on a condition.
Python
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
Break Statement: To exit a loop early.
Python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
Continue Statement: To skip to the next iteration.
Python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
Pass Statement: A placeholder when a statement is required syntactically.
Python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        pass
    print(i)
Return Statement: To exit a function and return a value.
Python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
